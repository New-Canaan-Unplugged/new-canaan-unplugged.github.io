    <h3>Is there a pledge I can sign?</h3>
    <p>New Canaan Unplugged seeks to create both a community and a resource for parents in New Canaan to help navigate the social media and smart phone landscape. If you are looking to make a pledge, Wait Until 8th is a great resource. Wait Until 8th is a national organization that empowers families to delay giving children a smartphone until at least the end of 8th grade.

    <h3>I already gave my kid a smartphone, now what?</h3>
    <p>There are still things you can do to support your child’s healthy use of technology once they have a smartphone, including:
      <ul class="more-space">
        <li>Create phone-free zones in your home, such as the dinner table and bedrooms</li>
        <li>Use a physical alarm clock (not a smartphone) to wake up in the morning</li>
        <li>Set the phone to grayscale (colors are more enticing and engrossing)</li>
        <li>Turn off all notifications, except from those that come from actual people (not machines)</li>
        <li>Use Apple’s Screentime or Android's Digital Wellbeing to block apps and notifications for periods when your child needs distraction-free time</li>
        <li>Work with your child to avoid or delete apps that make them feel bad while they are using them</li>
        <li>Use One Sec, which delays access to an app when your child opens it</li>
      </ul>
